# C++ Compiler

This project aims to develop a C++ compiler using principles of compiler design implemented in C++ programming language.

## Overview

This compiler translates C++ source code into executable machine code. It consists of the following components:

- **Lexer:** Tokenizes the input source code.
- **Parser:** Parses the token stream to determine the syntactic structure.
- **Semantic Analyzer:** Performs semantic analysis to check for language rules and constraints.
- **Intermediate Code Generator:** Generates intermediate representation for optimization and translation.
- **Code Optimizer:** Optimizes the intermediate code for efficiency.
- **Code Generator:** Translates the optimized code into target machine code.

## Usage

To use the C++ compiler, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kanishk-chaudhary/Kanishk_Compiler.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd cpp-compiler


3. Compile the source code:


4. Run the compiler with the input source code file:

./compiler input.cpp


5. The compiler will generate the executable output file:

./a.out
